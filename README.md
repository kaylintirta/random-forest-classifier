# Random Forest Classifier on Digits Dataset
For this project, we have a digits dataset from sklearn.datasets. The dataset contains 1797 samples with each datapoint being a 8x8 image of a digit.

The goal of this project is to create a Random Forest Classifier model to predict the digits based on the images of the digits.
